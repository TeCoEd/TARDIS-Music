I acquired an old Doctor Who Money Box from a car boot sale, for a pound, but it sat on the shelf for many months as I didn't know what to do with it.  Then Pimoroni released their Pirate Audio range.  A small HAT, or as they call them pHAT, which sits neatly on the top of a Raspberry Pi Zero.  Guess what, it is also the perfect size for attaching to one of the side panes of the Doctor's TARDIS.
